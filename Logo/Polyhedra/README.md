## Minimum Size and Clear Space


#### Minimum Size 
To maintain legibility and visual integrity, the Polyhedra logo must always be reproduced at a size that ensures clarity. The minimum recommended width must be followed to avoid compromising the logo’s readability. 

The minimum size of the Polyhedra logo is defined by the height of the symbol and should never be used below 32px/12mm.


#### Clear Space
The required clear space around the Polyhedra logo is determined by the side height of the symbol. This spacing must be maintained on all sides to ensure the logo’s visibility and impact.
